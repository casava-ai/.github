From a business standpoint, it's not clear to us yet where the value will accrue.
Will it be the underlying APIs, or the apps built on top of them?
The best models or the best model serving infrastructure?
```

This quote from Ankur Goyal elegantly summarises some of the challenges this technology will present to us. This nature of interplay between optimizing model output versus building out more advanced, smarter infrastructure that surrounds the models is one of the core conundrums we tend to wrestle with when thinking about how to proceed best when working with LLMs, and may even strike at the heart of the larger questions around AI alignment.
